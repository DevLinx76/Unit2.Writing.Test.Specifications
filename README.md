## Guided Practice: Understanding Test Specifications

### Overview
Delve deep into the intricacies of writing test specifications for a hypothetical e-commerce platform using pseudocode as the primary means of communication.

### Learning Objectives
- Get acquainted with various types of tests: unit, integration, and functional.
- Learn to draft test specifications using pseudocode.
- Understand the importance and applications of different testing scenarios in e-commerce.

### Steps to Follow:
1. **Setup**: Start by cloning the repository and navigating to the project directory.
2. **File Exploration**: Open the `pseudocode.js` file to examine the provided pseudocode for various test scenarios.
3. **Understanding Pseudocode**: Familiarize yourself with the syntax and logic used in the pseudocode. This will help you understand how the test scenarios are defined and structured.
4. **Functionality Analysis**: For each pseudocode function, identify the specific feature or functionality of the e-commerce platform it aims to test.
5. **Integration & Functional Tests**: Recognize the difference between unit tests, which test individual functionalities, and integration/functional tests, which might test the interaction between different functionalities or the system as a whole.
6. **Reflecting on Real-world Applications**: Think about how these test scenarios might apply to real-world e-commerce platforms you've used. What other tests might be important?

### Peer Review & Reflection
- Discuss with peers the importance of thorough testing in software, especially in critical applications like e-commerce.
- Reflect on the challenges in drafting test specifications and the balance between comprehensive testing and practicality.
- Share insights on how pseudocode can be a powerful tool for planning and communication in the software development process.

## Workshop: Crafting Test Specifications

### Overview
In this session, apply the knowledge gained from the guided practice to craft test specifications for hypothetical or real-world software scenarios.

### Instructions
1. **Initiation**: Start by selecting a software feature or functionality you want to draft test specifications for. It could be related to e-commerce or any other domain.
2. **Drafting Pseudocode**: Use the principles and format learned to draft pseudocode for various test scenarios related to the chosen feature.
3. **Review & Feedback**: Share your pseudocode with peers or mentors and gather feedback. Understand areas of improvement and iterate over your pseudocode if needed.

### Criteria for Evaluation
1. **Pseudocode Clarity**: Ensure that the pseudocode is clear, concise, and easy to understand.
2. **Comprehensiveness**: Ensure that the test specifications cover all crucial aspects of the chosen functionality.
3. **Real-world Relevance**: The drafted test scenarios should be practical and relevant to how the software might be used in real-world situations.
4. **Feedback Incorporation**: Demonstrate the ability to take feedback and improve upon the initial draft.
5. **Understanding of Testing**: Display a deep understanding of the importance of testing and how different tests serve different purposes.

### Submission
Once you are satisfied with your test specifications and have ensured they align with the evaluation criteria, you can share your pseudocode with the larger group or save it for future reference.
